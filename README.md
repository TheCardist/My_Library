# Personal Reading List and Statistics
I wanted to create a webapp that provided a list of all the books I've read along with various stats on my reading habits.

## Details
Using Streamlit I created this webapp to display a table of all the books I've read which are in the book_stats.csv. This csv comes from StoryGraph which is the site I use to catalog what I read. In addition to this there is a stats page where I display various stats on my reading habits including how many pages I read daily which is pulled from a Google Sheets document that I keep updated.
